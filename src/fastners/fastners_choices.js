            "The Keep-Nut is a self-anchoring fastener system. It can be used with almost any type of panel system without the need for adhesives or resin. Its use of crowns or teeth around the anchor creates a strong connection that leaves a flat surface for mounting clips and rails. They come in multiple sizes and rows of teeth, depending on the panel thickness, making it one of the most versatile anchors on the market.",

The TU-S system works with materials like HPL, while the TUF-S is a heavy-duty fastener for materials such as fiber cement panels. Similar to a rivet, these fasteners use radial expansion technology. Once the mandrel is removed, the stainless steel threads become wedged in the panel, creating a strong connection without the need for adhesives.",
